# Emg_data_analysis

  - This is intended to familiarize with biological data and (eventually) refresh basic 
skills such as informative plotting and infer information from data. 
  - After loading data1.mat, data2.mat and data3.mat, you are required to plot them with appropriate 
labels on the axis and try to guess which type of data you are plotting (EEG, EMG or motion 
data) and estimate roughly what is the frequency content of the signal (tip: plotting data in time 
points instead of sample would help)
